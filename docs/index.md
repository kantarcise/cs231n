# [CS231n - Deep Learning for Computer Vision](https://cs231n.stanford.edu/)

---

## Introduction

Back in 2023, **CS231n** helped me level up my deep learning fundamentals in a massive way. Even though it says *“Computer Vision”* in its name, it teaches far more than that 😍.

This was thanks to the legendary [Winter 2016 YouTube offering](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLkt2uSq6rBVctENoVBg1TpCC7OQi31AlC&si=OGuZANvYLqCbGV3r), taught by [Andrej Karpathy](https://karpathy.ai/), [Fei-Fei Li](https://profiles.stanford.edu/fei-fei-li), and [Justin Johnson](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~justincj/).

## Why does this page exist?

This website hosts **all the notes I took while going through CS231n**, especially the 2016 lectures.

My recommendation is to start with the 2016 version to build the fundamentals with minimum friction. You’ll enjoy the teaching style, and everything becomes easier when the basics click 🥰

## Content

Slides from 2016 are available [here](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/slides/2016/).
