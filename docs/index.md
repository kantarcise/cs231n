## Assignment 1 - Working on [2022 Version](https://cs231n.github.io/assignments2022/assignment1/)

In this assignment you will practice putting together a simple image classification pipeline, based on the k-Nearest Neighbor or the SVM/Softmax classifier. The goals of this assignment are as follows:

- understand the basic **Image Classification pipeline** and the data-driven approach (train/predict stages)
- understand the train/val/test **splits** and the use of validation data for **hyperparameter tuning**.
- develop proficiency in writing efficient **vectorized** code with numpy
- implement and apply a k-Nearest Neighbor (**kNN**) classifier
- implement and apply a Multiclass Support Vector Machine (**SVM**) classifier
- implement and apply a **Softmax** classifier
- understand the differences and tradeoffs between these classifiers
- get a basic understanding of performance improvements from using **higher-level representations** than raw pixels (e.g. color histograms, Histogram of Gradient (HOG) features)

## Assignment 2 - Working on [2022 Version](https://cs231n.github.io/assignments2022/assignment2/)

### Goals

- Understand **Neural Networks** and how they are arranged in layered architectures.
- Understand and be able to implement (vectorized) **backpropagation**.

For this part, you will be working with PyTorch, a popular and powerful deep learning framework. Open up `PyTorch.ipynb`. There, you will learn how the framework works, culminating in training a convolutional network of your own design on CIFAR-10 to get the best performance you can.

There was also a Network-Visualization question but that is moved to Assignment 3. 
## Assignment 3 - Working on [2022 Version](https://cs231n.github.io/assignments2022/assignment3/)

### Goals

In this assignment, you will implement language networks and apply them to image captioning on the COCO dataset. Then you will train a Generative Adversarial Network to generate images that look like a training dataset. Finally, you will be introduced to self-supervised learning to automatically learn the visual representations of an unlabeled dataset.

The goals of this assignment are as follows:

- Understand and implement RNN and Transformer networks. Combine them with CNN networks for image captioning.
- Understand how to train and implement a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to produce images that resemble samples from a dataset.
- Understand how to leverage self-supervised learning techniques to help with image classification tasks.
- You will use PyTorch for the majority of this homework.

### Q0: Network Visualization: Saliency Maps, Class Visualization, and Fooling Images
The notebook `Network_Visualization.ipynb` will introduce the pretrained SqueezeNet model, compute gradients with respect to images, and use them to produce saliency maps and fooling images.
### Q1: Image Captioning with Vanilla RNNs

### Q3: Generative Adversarial Networks
In the notebook `Generative_Adversarial_Networks.ipynb` you will learn how to generate images that match a training dataset and use these models to improve classifier performance when training on a large amount of unlabeled data and a small amount of labeled data. When first opening the notebook, go to Runtime > Change runtime type and set Hardware accelerator to GPU.
### Q4: Self-Supervised Learning for Image Classification
In the notebook `Self_Supervised_Learning.ipynb`, you will learn how to leverage self-supervised pretraining to obtain better performance on image classification tasks. When first opening the notebook, go to Runtime > Change runtime type and set Hardware accelerator to GPU.

Extra Credit: Image Captioning with LSTMs (5 points)
The notebook `LSTM_Captioning.ipynb` will walk you through the implementation of Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) RNNs and apply them to image captioning on COCO.
