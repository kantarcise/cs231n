No recorded lecture, I guess this is a recap.

First we defined Score Functions.

![15002](../img/cs231n/winter2016/15002.png)

Loss functions after.

![15003](../img/cs231n/winter2016/15003.png)

We learned how to optimize them.

![15004](../img/cs231n/winter2016/15004.png)

More powerful score functions.

![15005](../img/cs231n/winter2016/15005.png)

This bigger models gave us better results.

![15006](../img/cs231n/winter2016/15006.png)

We learned how the learning process goes.

![15007](../img/cs231n/winter2016/15007.png)

We explored Convolutional Neural Networks.

![15008](../img/cs231n/winter2016/15008.png)

Explored more and more.

![15009](../img/cs231n/winter2016/15009.png)

What are the downfalls of them?

![15010](../img/cs231n/winter2016/15010.png)

We learned style transfer.

![15011](../img/cs231n/winter2016/15011.png)

We discovered tricks on architecture.

![15012](../img/cs231n/winter2016/15012.png)

How can we make them work in practice as well.

![15013](../img/cs231n/winter2016/15013.png)

What are the bottlenecks happening?

![15014](../img/cs231n/winter2016/15014.png)

We saw that there are a lot of ways to do classification.

![15015](../img/cs231n/winter2016/15015.png)

ResNets == LSTM's. We also saw how RNN's work too.

![15016](../img/cs231n/winter2016/15016.png)

The dragon.

![15017](../img/cs231n/winter2016/15017.png)

You are ready.

![15018](../img/cs231n/winter2016/15018.png)

Conquer.

![15019](../img/cs231n/winter2016/15019.png)

Future.

![15020](../img/cs231n/winter2016/15020.png)

End.

![15021](../img/cs231n/winter2016/15021.png)

Thank you all.

# Jean Dean's Talk ðŸŒ³

Andrew NG was spending 1 week at Google.

Google Brain started 2011.

- **Research**: Speech, Images, Videos, Robotics, Language Understanding, NLP, translation, optimization algorithms and unsupervised learning
- **Production**: Advertising, Search, Gmail, Photos, Maps, YouTube, Speech Recognition, Image Analysis, User Prediction

Make the model run fast!

Scaling both is really good. Data and Model Size.

wip.
