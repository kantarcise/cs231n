# [CS231n - Deep Learning for Computer Vision](https://cs231n.stanford.edu/)

---

## Introduction

In 2023, **CS231n** helped me tremendously on improving my understanding of Deep Learning (PS: Even though the course includes ***"Computer Vision"*** in it's name, it's much more! üòç). 

This is thanks to the [Winter 2016 offering on Youtube](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLkt2uSq6rBVctENoVBg1TpCC7OQi31AlC&si=OGuZANvYLqCbGV3r) where [Andrej](https://karpathy.ai/) taught the class along with [Fei Fei Li](https://profiles.stanford.edu/fei-fei-li) and [Justin Johnson](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~justincj/).


## So if it's on YouTube, why does this page exist?

This website is hosting every single note I've taken from the course.

I think it's a really good idea to just listen and take notes from the 2016 offering. You know, enjoying the mastery of teaching there, before going in the latest offering (which would be Spring 2025).

If we can get the fundamentals right, with ***minimum friction***, everything will be easier ü•∞

## Content

Slides from 2016 are [here](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/slides/2016/).

Here is a great map from the 2016 offering.
